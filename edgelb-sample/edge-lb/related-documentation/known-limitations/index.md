Depending on the configuration of Edge_LB and your cluster environment, you might experience some limitations in Edge-LB features or functionality. Unlike issues that are typically found and fixed in minor or patch version updates, technical limitations can span multiple versions. 

## Current limitations
<!--* Edge-LB supports all [security modes](/1.13/security/ent/#security-modes) in DC/OS 1.11 and later.-->

* Edge-LB supports `permissive` and `disabled` security in DC/OS 1.10, but does not support `strict` security mode on DC/OS 1.10.

* Edge-LB currently does not support self-service configuration. All configuration must be handled centrally.

## Limitations in previous versions
The following previously-reported Edge-LB limitations have been resolved.

|<b> Known limitation description</b> | <b>Versions affected</b> | <b>Resolved by</b> |
|-------------------------------| ----------------- | ----------- |
Edge-LB does not support `disabled` security mode. | Edge-LB 1.0.2 (and older) | Edge-LB 1.1.0 (and newer)
The number of load balancer instances ocannot be scaled down | Edge-LB 1.0.2 (and older) | Edge-LB 1.0.3 (and newer)

# Known Edge-LB issues

* The steps provided in the DC/OS web interface to uninstall Edge-LB are incorrect. Follow the steps in [Uninstall](/services/edge-lb/1.2/uninstalling/) to uninstall Edge-LB.

* If you attempt to configure a pool with invalid constraints, the pool will not be created properly and will not respect pool deletion. To address this issue, you must manually remove the pool and recreate it.

## Known issues in previous versions
The following previously-reported Edge-LB issues have been resolved.

|<b>Known issue description</b>|<b>Versions affected</b>|<b>Resolved by</b>|
|------------------------------| ---------------------- | ---------------- |
If you are running Edge-LB on a CentOS/RHEL 7.2 node where `/var/lib/mesos` is formatted with `ext4`, you might see connection issues. | All | Not applicable
Edge-LB API Version-2 `backend.service` regular expression selectors do not work properly. | Edge-LB 1.0.1 (and older) | Edge-LB 1.0.2 (and newer) |
Edge-LB and Marathon-LB pool servers cannot run on the same agent without changing the default ports because they both require port 80 and port 443 for serving network traffic and port 9090 for HAProxy statistics and other endpoints by default. For information about how to configure Edge-LB using non-default ports, see the examples for pool configuration. | Edge-LB 1.0.1 (and older) | Edge-LB 1.0.2 (and newer) |
If Edge-LB is deployed on a public agent node in a DC/OS 1.10 or DC/OS 1.11 cluster that has Marathon applications deployed using persistent volumes, the schedulers may erroneously destroy one or more Marathon persistent volumes. Losing persistent volumes can result in potential data loss. | Edge-LB 1.0.0 (and older) | Edge-LB 1.0.1 (and newer)
