The tutorials in this section cover the following items:
<!--- how to prepare a service account and install Edge-LB for secure load balancing -->
- how to configure a single Edge-LB pool for load balancing multiple services
- how to configure multiple Edge-LB pool instances for load balancing multiple services
- how to install and configure Edge-LB for high availability on AWS
- how to use Edge-LB to perform a rolling blue/green service update
<!-- - how to configure Edge-LB for connecting to Kubernetes -->

If you are setting up a demonstration environment as a proof-of-concept for testing or evaluation purposes, you can use the simplified instructions provided in [Getting started](/services/edge-lb/getting-started). For a production environment or larger scale deployment, however, additional steps are typically required. For example, you might have superuser permissions to simplify security requirements in a demonstration environment or small cluster.
